# MarketingAnalytics-LobsterLand
## Introduction & Objective
The MarketingAnalytics-LobsterLand repository is a comprehensive marketing analysis of the Lobster Land, a fictitious amusement park, which will host an international conference of theme park operators and hoteliers. 

## Methods & Results: 
**Visualization & Summary Statistics:** This part was conducted on the historical theme park accidents dataset, which showed improved safety over time throughout the operators. In terms of injury causes, water slides account for the highest number of accidents, followed by coasters, and spinning rides. 

**Segmentation and Targeting:** Clustering analysis on the ski-themed hotel that provides three possible clusters of interest(the Slope Saver, the Alpine Haven, the Glacier Elite), along with unique characteristics, for the hoteliers at the conference. 

**Conjoint Analysis:** Proposed the combination of amenities for the new hotel along with its rate to better attract the consumer into the theme park. The Wi-Fi network and buffet breakfast are among the top features consumers care about the most. 

**Forecasting Total Spending:**  Forecasted Hyatt's and Hilton's future net income range by using Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) based on the historical trend of their past 10 years' net income data. 

**Classification:** Utilized Logistic Regression to predict hotel customer satisfaction, which was trained using historical hotel satisfaction data involving an array of predictors and achieved 84% accuracy.
